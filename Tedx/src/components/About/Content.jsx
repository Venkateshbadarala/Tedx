                        Technology, Entertainment and Design,the set of global conferences have been going with the spirit of ideas worth spreading since 1984. TED is a global community, welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world. TED believes passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world. TED is owned by a nonprofit, nonpartisan foundation. The agenda is to make great ideas accessible and spark conversation.

                            <b className='sm:text-4xl x-sm:text-3xl '>Imagine</b>&nbsp; yourself walking on your terrace during darks,
                            sweeping off the many mosquitoes,while juggling between the questions about boundaries of
                            life. If constraints define boundaries, TED defines essence of having no limits. TED which
                            means Technology Entertainment and Design, is a defined platform for infinite definitions.
                            While TED is an international nonprofit organization streaming with talks and creativity
                            where every little idea of this big universe is valued, TEDx can be considered as its little
                            sister with the same origin of inheritance, where x means independent. TEDx, just like TED,
                            welcomes speakers of different styles, types and languages; gives them a space to sharing
                            their idea, be it a big business management or an informal- 'first flight experience' which
                            fosters a little lesson of life. So, TEDx, operating over a specific region, working with
                            ideas as soul , speakers as passion and assembly as vision, invites everyone with a
                            worthwhile thought, to share and unleash the idea of experience.

                            experiences in life can drastically change a person who they are. No matter what the
